My hello to the world

Hello, Fellow Humans! Human fellas!
My screen name is SaltyGemio42 ! But you already know that. 
I am a young teen who has dipped their hand into the vast lake of programming, and wants more!
I can't wait to learn more about this vast and exiting field of science!

With love,
Your salty neighborhood programmer
